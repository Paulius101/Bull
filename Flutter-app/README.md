# Scale3C Flutter test #

1. Recreate design in Flutter app; 
2. It should be possible to navigate through the app anyway it looks logical to you;
3. Inputs values should have a state. 
4. Inputs should have basic validation to allow Login and Sign Up buttons to be pressed; (sign up password inputs should match and input values shouldn’t be empty) 
5. It’s not necessary to implement any login or sign up logic. 

### Bonus points if: ### 
 1. Login & Sign Up with email logic is implemented with any kind of service you like. (Firebase is highly recommended); 
2. Any kind of State Management was used for input or user states.

### Result: https://flutterapp-11d03.web.app ###
1. Login/ register logic implemented.
2. Notification messages added (to show valid and invalid login/ register attempts)
3. A bit of responsive design implemented for different viewhight.
4. Profile page guarded with angular guard.
5. Socials icons from angular fontawesome.
6. Sign-in page opening effect added for fun.
